-ATH 0 or 1 headers off on 0 = off 1 = on send ATH0 or ATH1 H0 and H1
 [ Headers off or on ]
 These commands control whether or not the
 additional (header) bytes of information are shown in
 the responses from the vehicle. These are not
 normally shown by the ELM327, but may be of interest
 (especially if you receive multiple responses and wish
 to determine what modules they were from).
 Turning the headers on (with AT H1) actually
 shows more than just the header bytes – you will see
 the complete message as transmitted, including the
 check-digits and PCI bytes, and possibly the CAN data
 length code (DLC) if it has been enabled with PP 29 or
 AT D1. The current version of this IC does not display
 the CAN CRC code, nor the special J1850 IFR bytes
 (which some protocols use to acknowledge receipt of a
 message)
